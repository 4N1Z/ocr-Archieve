      "[Document(page_content='Samuel Harris Altman (born April 22, 1985) is an American entrepreneur and investor best known as the CEO of OpenAI since 2019 (he was briefly fired and reinstated in November 2023). Altman is considered to be one of the leading figures of the AI boom. He dropped out of Stanford University after two years and founded Loopt, a mobile social networking service, raising more than $30 million in venture capital. In 2011, Altman joined Y Combinator, a startup accelerator, and was its president from 2014 to 2019.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nAltman was born on April 22, 1985, in Chicago, Illinois, into a Jewish family, and grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. His mother is a dermatologist, while his father was a real estate broker. Altman is the eldest of four siblings. At the age of eight, he received his first computer, an Apple Macintosh, and began to learn how to code and take apart computer hardware. He attended John Burroughs School, a private school in Ladue, Missouri. In 2005, after two years at Stanford University studying computer science, he dropped out without earning a bachelor\\'s degree.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early career ===\\nIn 2005, at the age of 19, Altman co-founded Loopt, a location-based social networking mobile application. As CEO, Altman raised more than $30 million in venture capital for the company, including an initial investment of $5 million from Patrick Chung of Xfund and his team at NEA, which was later followed by investments from Sequoia Capital and Y Combinator. In March 2012, after Loopt failed to gain traction with enough users, the company was acquired by the Green Dot Corporation for $43.4 million. The following month, Altman co-founded Hydrazine Capital with his brother, Jack Altman, which is still in operation.\\nAltman became a partner at Y Combinator, a startup accelerator that invests in a wide range of startups, in 2011, initially working there on a part-time basis. In February 2014, Altman was named president of Y Combinator by co-founder Paul Graham. In a 2014 blog post, Altman said that the total valuation of Y Combinator companies had surpassed $65 billion, including Airbnb, Dropbox, Zenefits and Stripe. In September 2016, Altman announced his expanded role as president of YC Group, which included Y Combinator and other units. Altman said that he hoped to expand Y Combinator to fund 1,000 new companies per year. He also tried to expand the types of companies funded by YC, especially \"hard technology\" companies. In October 2015, Altman announced YC Continuity, a $700 million equity fund investing in YC companies as they matured. A week earlier, Altman had introduced Y Combinator Research, a non-profit research lab, and donated $10 million to fund it. In March 2019, YC announced Altman\\'s transition from the president of the company to a less hands-on role as chairman of the board, for him to focus on OpenAI. This decision came shortly after YC announced it would be moving its headquarters to San Francisco. As of early 2020, he was no longer affiliated with YC. It was later reported that Altman was fired from YC and had appointed himself chairman without authorization.\\nAltman co-founded Tools For Humanity in 2019, a company which builds and distributes systems designed to scan people\\'s eyes to provide authentication and verify proof of personhood to counter fraud. People who agree to have their eyes scanned are compensated with a cryptocurrency called Worldcoin. Tools For Humanity describes its cryptocurrency as similar to universal basic income.\\nAltman has several other investments, including \"Humane,\" the world\\'s first wearable computer powered by AI, \"Retro Biosciences,\" a research company aiming to extend human life by 10 years, and \"Helion Energy,\" an American fusion research company.\\n\\n\\n=== OpenAI ===\\n\\nOpenAI was initially funded by Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Infosys and YC Research.

The removal was caused by concerns about his handling of Artificial Intelligence safety, and allegations of abusive behavior.  Altman was reinstated on November 22 after pressure from employees and investors.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\n\\n\\n=== OpenAI ===\\n\\nOpenAI is an artificial intelligence firm founded in December 2015 as a non-profit entity. The for-profit division of the organization released the chatbot ChatGPT in November 2022, contributing to a resurgence in generative artificial intelligence funding. The board of directors of the controlling non-profit formerly comprised chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, as well as Adam D\\'Angelo, chief executive of Quora, entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, and Helen Toner, strategy director for the Center for Security and Emerging Technology. As of October 2023, the company is valued at US$80 billion and was set to bring in US$1 billion in revenue. Altman has described OpenAI\\'s relationship with Microsoft as the \"best bromance in tech\".OpenAI is uniquely structured, an intentional decision to avoid investor control. A board of directors controls the non-profit OpenAI, Inc. The non-profit owns and controls a for-profit company itself controlling a capped-profit company, OpenAI Global, LLC and a holding company owned by employees and other investors. The holding company is the majority owner of OpenAI Global, LLC.; Microsoft owns a minority stake in the capped-profit company. OpenAI\\'s bylaws, enacted in January 2016, allow a majority of its board of directors to remove any director without prior warning or a formal meeting with written consent.\\n\\n\\n=== Sam Altman ===\\n\\nSam Altman is a co-founder of OpenAI and its former chief executive; Altman took over the company following co-chair Elon Musk\\'s resignation in 2018. Under Altman, OpenAI has shifted to becoming a for-profit entity. Altman is credited with convincing Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella with investing US$10 billion in cash and computing credits into OpenAI and leading several tender offer transactions that tripled the company\\'s valuation. Altman testified before the United States Congress speaking critically of artificial intelligence and appeared at the 2023 AI Safety Summit.In the days leading up to his removal, Altman made several public appearances, announcing the GPT-4 Turbo platform at OpenAI\\'s DevDay conference, attending APEC United States 2023, and speaking at an event related to Burning Man.\\n\\n\\n== Events leading up to the removal ==\\nThe resignation of LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, venture capitalist Shivon Zilis, and former Republican representative Will Hurd from the board allowed the remaining members to remove Altman. According to Kara Swisher and The Wall Street Journal, Sutskever was instrumental in Altman\\'s removal. Disagreements over the safety of artificial intelligence divided employees prior to Altman\\'s removal. The release of ChatGPT created divisions with OpenAI as a for-profit company without considerations for the safety of artificial intelligence and a non-profit cautious of artificial intelligence\\'s capabilities; in a staff email sent in 2019 and obtained by The Atlantic, Altman referred to these divisions as \"tribes\".Prior to his removal, Altman was seeking billions from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds to develop an artificial intelligence chip to compete with Nvidia and courted SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son to develop artificial intelligence hardware with former Apple designer Jony Ive. Sutskever and his allies opposed these efforts, viewing them as unjustly using the OpenAI name. Altman reduced Sutskever\\'s role in October 2023, furthering divisions; Sutskever successfully appealed to several members of the board. Swisher and The Verge reporter Alex Heath stated that opposition to Altman\\'s profit-driven strategy culminated in the DevDay conference in ', metadata={'title': 'Removal of Sam Altman from OpenAI', 'summary': \"On November 17, 2023, OpenAI's board of directors removed co-founder and chief executive Sam Altman after the board had no confidence in his leadership.

Altman was reinstated on November 22 after pressure from employees and investors.\\n\\n\", 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removal_of_Sam_Altman_from_OpenAI'}), Document(page_content='OpenAI is a U.S.-based artificial intelligence (AI) research organization founded in December 2015, researching artificial intelligence with the goal of developing \"safe and beneficial\" artificial general intelligence, which it defines as \"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work\".\\nAs one of the leading organizations of the AI boom, it has developed several large language models, advanced image generation models, and previously, released open-source models. Its release of ChatGPT has been credited with starting the AI boom.\\nThe organization consists of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc. registered in Delaware and its for-profit subsidiary OpenAI Global, LLC. It was founded by Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba, with Sam Altman and Elon Musk serving as the initial Board of Directors members. Microsoft provided OpenAI Global LLC with a $1 billion investment in 2019 and a $10 billion investment in 2023, with a significant portion of the investment in the form of computational resources on Microsoft\\'s Azure cloud service.\\nOn November 17, 2023, the board removed Altman as CEO, while Brockman was removed as chairman and then resigned as president. Four days later, both returned after negotiations with the board, and most of the board members resigned. The new initial board included former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor as chairman. It was also announced that Microsoft will have a non-voting board seat.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2015–2018: Non-profit beginnings ===\\nIn December 2015, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys, and YC Research announced the formation of OpenAI and pledged over $1 billion to the venture. The actual collected total amount of contributions was only $130 million until 2019. According to an investigation led by TechCrunch, Musk was its largest donor while YC Research did not contribute anything at all. The organization stated it would \"freely collaborate\" with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public. OpenAI is headquartered at the Pioneer Building in Mission District, San Francisco.\\nAccording to Wired, Brockman met with Yoshua Bengio, one of the \"founding fathers\" of deep learning, and drew up a list of the \"best researchers in the field\".

The token will be a Layer 2 Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that leverages the security of the Ethereum blockchain while having its own economy.\\nIn October 2021, the project raised an initial $25 million. Within six months, an additional $100 million was raised, pushing the token\\'s value up to $3 billion.\\nIn April 2022, a report from MIT Technology Review cited those from the community who accused Worldcoin of \"taking advantage of students\" and \"targeting lower-income communities\", and came to the conclusion that \"it\\'s just cheaper and easier to run this kind of data collection operation in places where people have little money and few legal protections.\"\\nIn May 2023, TechCrunch reported that hackers had been able to steal login credentials of several of Worldcoin\\'s operators\\' personal devices including their credentials to the Worldcoin operator app. However, Worldcoin\\'s spokesperson said that no personal user data was compromised, as the operator app does not access user data.\\nFurther funding of $115 million was announced in May 2023, to be used for investment into bot detection, research and development, and expanding the Worldcoin project and application. While in beta, Worldcoin was reported to have onboarded approximately two million users.\\nWorldcoin launched out of beta on July 24, 2023 with 11 orb locations in the U.S. and plans for 35 cities in 20 countries. Users in London received 25 WLD tokens for scanning their irises. WLD tokens became freely tradable on several cryptocurrency exchanges, though not in the U.S.\\nIn August 2023, Kenya, one of the first countries where Worldcoin was launched, suspended its enrollment in the country, citing security, privacy and financial concerns. Worldcoin was previously ordered to stop collecting personal data by the Kenyan Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, but did not comply. Worldcoin also stopped offline verifications in India.\\nOn March 6, 2024, the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) ordered Worldcoin to stop its activity of “collection of biometric data” and to “block all data collected in Spanish territory”.\\n\\n\\n== Design ==\\n\\nWorldcoin hopes to provide a reliable way to authenticate humans online called World ID, to counter bots and fake virtual identities facilitated by artificial intelligence. Worldcoin attempts to recruit new users to join its network by getting their iris scanned using Worldcoin\\'s orb-shaped iris scanner in return for some WLD tokens. In order to access their WLD, users are required to provide an email address or phone number and use the Worldcoin app. Worldcoin claims the distribution mechanism was inspired by universal basic income discussions.\\nTen percent of all WLD tokens are reserved for Worldcoin investors, and another 10 percent are reserved for Worldcoin employees. Worldcoin uses so-called \"operators\" to sign up new users. These are independent contractors paid per sign-up in Tether stable coin.\\n\\n\\n== Controversies ==\\nThe currency has not formally launched in the US and other countries because of concerns by national regulators regarding privacy and potential use of the tokens for fraudulent purposes.\\nIn late January 2024 representatives of the Hong Kong Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data executed warrants on six Worldcoin offices in Hong Kong.

It was launched on March 14, 2023, and made publicly available via the paid chatbot product ChatGPT Plus, via OpenAI\\'s API, and via the free chatbot Microsoft Copilot.  As a transformer-based model, GPT-4 uses a paradigm where pre-training using both public data and \"data licensed from third-party providers\" is used to predict the next token. After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.:\\u200a2\\u200a\\nObservers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions. GPT-4, equipped with vision capabilities (GPT-4V), is capable of taking images as input on ChatGPT. OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\n \\nOpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\" It was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books. The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text. In 2020, they introduced GPT-3, a model with 100 times as many parameters as GPT-2, that could perform various tasks with few examples. GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.\\nRumors claim that GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion parameters, which was first estimated by the speed it was running and by George Hotz.\\n\\n\\n== Capabilities ==\\nOpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\" They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively. Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input; this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams. It  can now interact with users through spoken words and respond to images, allowing for more natural conversations and the ability to provide suggestions or answers based on photo uploads. \\nTo gain further control over GPT-4, OpenAI introduced the \"system message\", a directive in natural language given to GPT-4 in order to specify its tone of voice and task. For example, the system message can instruct the model to \"be a Shakespearean pirate\", in which case it will respond in rhyming, Shakespearean prose, or request it to \"always write the output of [its] response in JSON\", in which case the model will do so, adding keys and values as it sees fit to match the structure of its reply. In the examples provided by OpenAI, GPT-4 refused to deviate from its system message despite requests to do otherwise by the user during the conversation.\\nWhen instructed to do so, GPT-4 can interact with external interfaces. For example, the model could be instructed to enclose a query within <search></search> tags to perform a web search, the result of which would be inserted into the model\\'s prompt to allow it to form a response. This allows the model to perform tasks beyond its normal text-prediction capabilities, such as using APIs, generating images, and accessing and summarizing webpages.\\nA 2023 article in Nature stated programmers have found GPT-4 useful for assisting in coding tasks (despite its propensity for error), such as finding errors in existing cod', metadata={'title': 'GPT-4', 'summary': 'Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its series of GPT foundation models.

After speaking with Huffman and Ohanian following the lecture, Graham invited the two to apply to his startup incubator Y Combinator. Their initial idea, My Mobile Menu, was unsuccessful, and was intended to allow users to order food by SMS text messaging. During a brainstorming session to pitch another startup, the idea was created for what Graham called the \"front page of the Internet\". For this idea, Huffman and Ohanian were accepted in Y Combinator\\'s first class. Supported by the funding from Y Combinator, Huffman coded the site in Common Lisp and together with Ohanian launched Reddit in June 2005. Embarrassed by an empty-looking site, the founders created hundreds of fake users for their posts to make it look more populated, an example of a fake it till you make it strategy.\\nThe team expanded to include Christopher Slowe in November 2005. Between November 2005 and January 2006, Reddit merged with Aaron Swartz\\'s company Infogami, and Swartz became an equal owner of the resulting parent company, Not A Bug. Swartz went on to help rewrite the software running Reddit using web.py, a web framework he developed. The passage from Aaron Swartz\\'s blog post \"Rewriting Reddit\" reveals that the switch from Lisp to Python, specifically using the web.py framework developed by Swartz, was driven by a desire for simplicity, maintainability, and performance.

The band consists of Allen Aucoin (drums), Marc \"Brownie\" Brownstein  (bass guitar, vocals), Jon \"The Barber\" Gutwillig  (guitar, vocals), and Aron Magner (keyboards, synths, vocals). The band incorporates elements from a variety of musical genres with a base of electronic and rock. Their style has been described as trance fusion.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe Disco Biscuits formed in 1995 at the University of Pennsylvania. Brownstein, Gutwillig, Magner, and the original drummer, Sam \"Sammy\" Altman, bonded over a shared affinity for psychedelic rock, electronic music, soul, blues, jazz and classical music. This eclectic mix of interests helped inspire their distinctive style of live electronic music, which is sometimes called \\'trance fusion\\'. The term references the band\\'s choice to incorporate elements of trance music - specifically the driving, rhythmically repetitive drum beats and melodic sections that repeat and evolve over time - into the instrumentation and conventions of a live jam-band where guitar, bass, keyboards, and drums play structured songs with sections for exploratory improvisation. \\nThe band honed their style while playing at bars and fraternity-house shows in the Philadelphia area in the mid-1990s. Bassist Marc Brownstein credits the improvisational ingenuity demonstrated by the jam-band Phish during the 95-97 tours as a particular inspiration for the Disco Biscuits\\' unique sound. He recognized that improvisation-inclined bands (largely inspired by Phish and the Grateful Dead) needed to differentiate their sound in meaningful ways in order to stand out in the underground mid-to-late-1990s live music scene, and the Biscuits members\\' interest in electronic music provided an excellent opportunity to explore a unique sound. \\nThe band received particular acclaim from fans during their 1999 tours for the thoughtful setlist compositions mixed with exploratory improvisation. This era (which has been referred to as \\'the nine-nine\\' by Disco Biscuits fans) featured energetic musical improvisation that incorporated new musical elements while still remaining enjoyable to more mainstream jam-band audiences whose tastes tended to gravitate towards folk-rock and blues. \\nThe first inklings of what ultimately became trance-fusion emerged during shows played by the band shortly after keyboardist Aron Magner incorporated a Roland JP-8000 into his live setup in late 1997. This analog-modeling synthesizer (which incidentally also features prominently in the popular track Sandstorm by Finnish electronic artist Darude) supplied sounds that lent a distinctly electronic flavor to jams that were in most other ways typical Phish-inspired blues-rock improvisations. The Halloween 1997 set at the Phi Kappa Gamma fraternity house near the University of Pennsylvania campus is unofficially recognized as the first show that incorporated the JP-8000, helping cement the Biscuits\\' connection to live, improvised electronic music. \\nIn 2005 drummer Sammy Altman left the band to pursue a career in medicine. The band began a search for their next drummer ending with a two-night, sold-out drum-off concert at the Borgata\\'s Music Box in Atlantic City. In December 2005 Allen Aucoin was announced as the newest member of the band. Aucoin knew members of the Biscuits\\' road crew and had opened for the Biscuits in the past. In 2006 the band purchased the Old City Philadelphia studio space that had previously belonged to DJ Jazzy Jeff. The space became a place for local musicians to congregate and work, culminating in the unique collaborations recorded in recording studio efforts known as the Planet Anthem sessions. Around the time Planet Anthem was released, the Biscuits also collaborated with noted hip-hop producer Damon Dash working on a variety of projects.\\n\\n\\n== Camp Bisco ==\\n\\nThe first Camp Bisco took place in August 1999 in Cherrytree Pennsylvania, the band seeking to combine the creative effects of e', metadata={'title': 'Disco Biscuits', 'summary': 'The Disco Biscuits are an American jam band from Philadelphia.

Users on its free tier can access the GPT-3.5-based version, while the more advanced GPT-4 and other features are released under the \"ChatGPT Plus\" paid subscription service.\\n\\n\\n== Training ==\\nChatGPT is based on particular GPT foundation models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, that were fine-tuned to target conversational usage. The fine-tuning process leveraged supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation. These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of proximal policy optimization.\\nTime magazine revealed that, to build a safety system against harmful content (e.g., sexual abuse, violence, racism, sexism), OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan workers earning less than $2 per hour to label harmful content. These labels were used to train a model to detect such content in the future. The outsourced laborers were exposed to \"toxic\" and traumatic content; one worker described the assignment as \"torture\". OpenAI\\'s outsourcing partner was Sama, a training-data company based in San Francisco, California.\\nChatGPT initially used a Microsoft Azure supercomputing infrastructure, powered by Nvidia GPUs, that Microsoft built specifically for OpenAI and that reportedly cost \"hundreds of millions of dollars\". Following ChatGPT\\'s success, Microsoft dramatically upgraded the OpenAI infrastructure in 2023. Scientists at the University of California, Riverside, estimate that a series of prompts to ChatGPT needs approximately 500 milliliters (18 imp fl oz; 17 U.S. fl oz) of water for Microsoft servers cooling. TrendForce market intelligence estimated that 30,000 Nvidia GPUs (each costing approximately $10,000–15,000) were used to power ChatGPT in 2023.\\nOpenAI collects data from ChatGPT users to train and fine-tune the service further. Users can upvote or downvote responses they receive from ChatGPT and fill in a text field with additional feedback.\\nChatGPT\\'s training data includes software manual pages, information about internet phenomena such as bulletin board systems, multiple programming languages, and the text of Wikipedia.\\n\\n\\n== Features and limitations ==\\n\\n\\n=== Features ===\\nAlthough a chatbot\\'s core function is to mimic a human conversationalist, Chat', metadata={'title': 'ChatGPT', 'summary': 'ChatGPT is a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022.

It was developed as an initiative by Elon Musk as a direct response to the rise of OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT which Musk co-founded. The chatbot is advertised as \"having a sense of humor\" and direct access to Twitter (X). It is currently under beta testing for those with the premium version of X.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nMusk co-founded the AI research organization OpenAI with Sam Altman in 2015. Musk left the company\\'s board in 2018, saying of his decision that he \"didn\\'t agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do\". OpenAI went on to launch ChatGPT in 2022, and GPT-4 in March 2023. That month, Elon Musk was one of individuals to sign an open letter from the Future of Life Institute calling for a six-month pause in the development of any AI software more powerful than GPT-4.\\nIn April 2023, Elon Musk said in an interview on Tucker Carlson Tonight that he intended to develop an AI chatbot called \"TruthGPT\", which he described as \"a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe\". He expressed concern to Carlson that ChatGPT was being \"trained to be politically correct\".\\nTruthGPT would later become known as \"Grok\", a verb coined by Robert A. Heinlein in his 1961 science-fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land to describe a form of understanding.\\nIn December 2023 the Silicon Valley start-up Curio launched a range of AI-powered children\\'s toys, including a rocket-shaped character named Grok. The toy is voiced by Musk\\'s ex-girlfriend Grimes, who is also an investor in the start-up, but the product is unrelated to the xAI service.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nIn November 2023, xAI began previewing Grok as a chatbot to selected people, with participation in the early access program being limited to paid X Premium users. It was announced that once the bot was out of early beta, it would only be available to higher tier X Premium+ subscribers. At the time of the preview, xAI described the chatbot as \"a very early beta product – the best we could do with 2 months of training\" that could \"improve rapidly with each passing week\".\\nOn March 11, 2024, Musk posted on X that the language model would go open source within a week and six days later, on March 17, Grok became open source.\\nOn March 17, 2024, Grok-1 was open sourced under the Apache-2.0 license.\\nOn March 26, 2024, Musk announced that Grok would be enabled for all premium subscribers, not just those on the higher-end tier, Premium+.\\nOn March 29, 2024, Grok-1.5 was announced, with \"improved reasoning capabilities\" and a context length of 128,000 tokens. \\nOn April 4, 2024, an update to X\\'s \"Explore\" page included summaries of breaking news stories written by Grok, a task previously assigned to a human curation team. When a large number of verified users began to spread false stories about Iran having attacked Israel on April 4 (nine days before the 2024 Iranian strikes in Israel), Grok treated the story as real and created a headline and paragraph-long summary of the event. Days later it reacted to many users joking about the solar eclipse with the summarized headline \"Sun\\'s Odd Behavior: Experts Baffled\".\\nOn April 12, 2024, Grok-1.5 Vision (Grok-1.5V) was announced. Grok-1.5V is able to process a wide variety of visual information, including documents, diagrams, graphs, screenshots, and photographs.\\n\\n\\n== Features ==\\nAn xAI statement described the chatbot as having been designed to \"answer questions with a bit of wit\" and as having \"a rebellious streak\", as well as a willingness to \"answer spicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems\". It said that bot had been \"modeled after The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy, so intended to answer almost anything\".\\nAn extract shared by an X employee showed Grok being asked to answer the question \"When is it appropriate to listen to Christmas music?\" in a vulgar manner, and responding \"whenever the hell you want\" and add', metadata={'title': 'Grok (chatbot)', 'summary': 'Grok is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by xAI, based on a large language model (LLM).

This attention mechanism allows the model to selectively focus on segments of input text it predicts to be most relevant. It uses a 2048-tokens-long context, float16 (16-bit) precision, and a hitherto-unprecedented 175 billion parameters, requiring 350GB of storage space as each parameter takes 2 bytes of space, and has demonstrated strong \"zero-shot\" and \"few-shot\" learning abilities on many tasks.\\nOn September 22, 2020, Microsoft announced that it had licensed GPT-3 exclusively. Others can still receive output from its public API, but only Microsoft has access to the underlying model.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nAccording to The Economist, improved algorithms, more powerful computers, and a recent increase in the amount of digitized material have fueled a revolution in machine learning. New techniques in the 2010s resulted in \"rapid improvements in tasks”, including manipulating language.\\nSoftware models are trained to learn by using thousands or millions of examples in a \"structure ... loosely based on the neural architecture of the brain\". One architecture used in natural language processing (NLP) is a neural network based on a deep learning model that was introduced in 2017—the transformer architecture. There are a number of NLP systems capable of processing, mining, organizing, connecting and contrasting textual input, as well as correctly answering questions.\\nOn June 11, 2018, OpenAI researchers and engineers published a paper introducing the first generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)—a type of generative large language model that is pre-trained with an enormous and diverse text corpus in datasets, followed by discriminative fine-tuning to focus on a specific task. GPT models are transformer-based deep-learning neural network architectures. Previously, the best-performing neural NLP models commonly employed supervised learning from large amounts of manually-labeled data, which made it prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to train extremely large language models. The first GPT model was known as \"GPT-1,\" and it was followed by \"GPT-2\" in February 2019. Created as a direct scale-up of its predecessor, GPT-2 had both its parameter count and dataset size increased by a factor of 10. It had 1.5 billion parameters, and was trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages. \\nIn February 2020, Microsoft introduced its Turing Natural Language Generation (T-NLG), which they claimed was \"largest language model ever published at 17 billion parameters.\" It performed better than any other language model at a variety of tasks, including summarizing texts and answering questions.\\n\\n\\n== Training and capabilities ==\\n\\nOn May 28, 2020, an arXiv preprint by a group of 31 engineers and researchers at OpenAI described the achievement and development of GPT-3, a third-generation \"state-of-the-art language model\". The team increased the capacity of GPT-3 by over two orders of magnitude from that of its predecessor, GPT-2, making GPT-3 the largest non-sparse language model to date.:\\u200a14\\u200a Because GPT-3 is structurally similar to its predecessors, its greater accuracy is attributed to its increased capacity and greater number of parameters. GPT-3\\'s capacity is ten times larger than that of Microsoft\\'s Turing NLG, the next largest NLP model known at the time.\\nLambdalabs estimated a hypothetical cost of around $4.6 million US dollars and 355 years to train GPT-3 on a single GPU in 2020, with lower actual training time by using more GPUs in parallel.\\nSixty percent of the weighted pre-training dataset for GPT-3 comes from a filtered version of Common Crawl consisting of 410 billion byte-pair-encoded tokens.:\\u200a9\\u200a Other sources are 19 billion tokens from WebText2 represent', metadata={'title': 'GPT-3', 'summary': 'Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a large language model released by OpenAI in 2020.

all app so without further ado let get started what is no squas Once Upon a Time way back in 1736 there was a sweet M named Leonard eer who faced a mindbending challenge the seven breach of kbur problem is there a way to walk across all bries ones starting and ending at the same place eer heis something more crucial what matter was how things were connected so you turn the city's lanmark into dots or nodes and its preaches into lives for ages creating a neat little Network known as the origin of the graph Theory story time is both for SP hold on instead of just buing about landmarks and Brides now Las thing be so he mention notes as to the adjective such as people buildings schools bands and many more and that the ages as the relationship B them for example there is ammy working at a bank and chatting away in Mand now house and Brian also B bound who loves fried R oh there's also an Brian's friend who is btic for fried R too and also FL in Mandarin sounds a bit Tangled right but look at the graph we have got suddenly all starts to make SS now with the idea of notes and ages and the team in relationship with this VRA hey let's get our world is not just a and Amy and Brian it's not just about B and fr price too right so it's a fast thrill of people teams ads and all of those have this special relationship and that's what we call as a knowledge craft so once again knowledge craft is a network of real world entities and and illustrates the relationship between them over we store the no scub in a graph database such as na Forge database and process it using cyber query language n cyber query language includes claes like use match read rer and more you can delve into them further with this new 4G chit now let's talk about how ncft EMP powering alen so using a noge graph you can identify the links even Sly disconnected C what do it means so February 2024 researchers from Microsoft conducted a research to compare Bas retrieval out Meed generon system or rack and graph rack danus filot incident information for a news article data set and the posit questions what has no forus yet done the result baseland white not able to answer it because sometimes using factor is not was a facted especially when the query does not provide enough context about its true intent or when the context is fragment across large corus of tax you probably have hearded about Plus in the middle things and that's the problem and they Pro that gra able to answer this questions because first the about entities which has no FIA this allows the El them to gr itself and then provide a fair to answer in November 2023 there is also a resarch that show how noge gra optimize the SE in a SQL database the researchers revealed that question answering using gbd4 with zero shut problems directly on SQL database achieves an accuracy of 16% notably this accuracy increases 54% when questions are posed over a Knowledge Graph representation on the Enterprise SQL database okay so that's the reason why learn knowledge SC our LM is very interesting and important and before we go into code it's better for us to understand how it works so first in here we will get the user question and then we'll pass this user question to our LM in this TP our LM will also receive a database schema database schema means like the entities and relationship that we already Store to our new forg database and the whole process in here we call it as the graph chain and then from the graph team it will generate a cyber query and then we will run the Cyber query to our new for database to get a result and the result we will pass it to the LM in here the LM will pass the result we create result into our final answer and this St we will get the final one okay th the Cod so actually all the code the data I've already provided in this GitHub and I already put it in the description so the first thing that we need to do is just to clone this so just copy and then go to our FAS code and do K Club here okay guys what stand our next St will be creating a virtual environment so just go to our folder and then do pip install it this it will take a few seconds so I will skip this part now let's open the notep that we have in here so since three already installed all the buttons they from the install that we've just done before so let's run this one so in here all go say we going to use open source L which is the Gemini and then having face and also near so I'll go work on how to get the API for all this but before that we need to cre F to sa B variable and just do this the Google API key so just go over this URL and then or create API if you can have it and for Hing face just follow this link and then use new token but since I already have this tokens so just copy and then save our envirment fre aable and for near forg actually can use my near forg desktop or for this I'll use near hour is uh little simpler so if you don't have a con you should sign up in here okay so the instant is ready and now like click open okay so in here we have the connection URL in here we have the database user and also password make sure to also copy the connection URL and the database username to the environment variable the file so right next is copy paste the password and like connect now the database is connect connected and now the next test is how to connect the python in here to the our database in n4g so actually lch ready provide us with a very simple connector which is this one lch Comm manity to C na for C here so just click run it's all done okay guys so we have done to set up everything so now let's talk about the data itself so the data that we will use in here I will keep it simple we won process a data from the unstructured format such as the PDF the text file no but in here we will use from data from Koo so that is for Manus Kumar for providing this data set so basically is a Linkin data set at professional information like the me the CP and and caring company that they work in the position and many more and actually year we did a little bit preprocessing to finally get this final data the next thing is how to insert this data to na for database so as you can see here says our data in na forg is still empty to know zero and the relationship zero and you can also check it by run to cell you can in here there's nothing in here so how to input it so the first thing that in here is by using the Cyber query to interact with our databit now I'll explain one by one startop from here load CSV with headers from blah blah blah blah so actually it's loading the CSV file from this gith repository and then as R me file for each row and in here is a cyber query inside so we known that okay in here name is the entity of name is person so we make it to Define The Entity that we have in our database so here it's a little bit different with the previous one right so basically we use for is because if you see in the language in here sometimes one people speaks man languages such as Roberto Mira he can speaks English Italian France Dutch and German so here we separate with this s and this line is talking about the relationship if you don't remember about the explanation about relationship entity so this one is the relationship or the ages just run this one okay and let's check it okay so now our data is already in the Nao forg database and check once again let's reload this okay see now we have the company now we have ocated at Country industrial language all the data in from CSP is already imputed in our NE for okay guys now let's talk about the most interesting part of this video how to operate the light L model to interact with our knowledge gra in NE so here we are using chap Google generative AI German Pro open source and then the API can here is the parameter that we have saved if we in file and in here we set the temporate to zero the question is why do you not set it to 0.5 or 0.9 the reason is because in this test we need the LM not to do a creative writing but we needed to translate the natural language to a cyber query language and then here the chain with the chain with graph cyber Q L has provided very easy to use so the graph is the graph that we have defining here and LM is the model that we want to use and for both I set it to close through what does it mean because I want to understand what happened Beyond LOL so right to and then in here we have several questions I've already created a table that contains a pair of the question and the correct answer so it becomes easier for us to check whether the answer resulted from the LM is correct or not we want to know how it's perform so let's run it okay that's cool okay so now let's talk how about result so the first questions L companies and advertising Serv industry in here it gener that cyber Under full contacts is said and J is Tob creative B advertising that's perfect and the second question is a working graduated from cyber FR University is currently employed at okay I'm not sure why but the J cyber query in here look a bit messy and that's why there's a no in the Contex are the result is I do not have the information we filed here and then the third question where is Power LS working okay so sure the J cyber query is correct and the full contact in here tobox cre if this is correct but I don't sure why the Finish Ching here IEM at the answer the four questions we see po here which actually if you remember about the schema of our database the relationship there's no spoken in in our database right so that's why it's no and I didn't have that information the last one is okay problem is the same is not actually it's kind of hting about relationship by the properties by entities right because we don't have relationship is native of in our schema so that's why it's also wrong the answer is zero the correct answer is one now let's do quick recap the result that we have got before so here we have two correct answer and three false answer from the elet right and from this result we can identify some problems the first one is not being able to accurately translate text into a cyber query and the second one is hallucinates properties relationship and entities this one is one of the biggest problems in llm in generating a cyber query so what's the solution we called it as prompting strategies so in short we provide examples to our model to help it understand the structure correctly similar to how parents guide us when we learn to work right more examples makes the models learns and smarter now let's jump to code so the first thing that we need to do is to create pairs of question and sever query so I do it manually just copy this and paste the jity okay once we got a result so just copy and paste it to our psod for example in here I want to copy this questions and the most important part is to treat attack once again if the jtic query from the jity is already not we can do this by going to our new copy paste and check okay good we have this the C queries right just do all that and copy ping here the last thing that you need to do is to add places in here because if you don't do it you I've already have this one so I won't use it I'll use mine to this friends and in here actually langin already provide us with a f shot prom template and so prom template this is the problem that we want to use that we use as a parameter in here and the example is is example that we have already divid in here so it will take the top three examples from it and then the perfect s and here is the input variables which is equation and schema we'll use it equation in this and the schema in here so run this one this is the example of the problem let's create our second change and check this for the first question the answer is correct to box creative big advertising into people school and for the second question we get a correct answer which is elastic pad and in here we got toolbox creative but the four question the Gen cqu is also correct and we get here fali new and then for the last one okay we got a card corre answer though which is one so using the problem strategies will enhance our model right now we have all correct answer okay guys our job is done but as I've told you before that I have a bonus for you so if you're still remember we have this question where do Michael work and the problem that we got is which workers friends what industries a workers named animal associated with and we workers live in Canada and speak German so actually there's no correlation right between which workers friend and where do Michael and the reason is this line so in here we are taking top three from this list in fact we have more than three questions so what's the point to just only take this top three and that's why we need a dynamic problem so to create a dynamic problem we need a semantic similarity example selector so basically you calculate which one is the closest between the question and the Leist that we have so the first one that you need is the haing fees eddings and then the for Factor so previously we are taking the top three question from the examples list now we will use the example selector to create a dynamic Pro if you run this so where do Michael work what companies the workers named John working it's makes sense where the workers named Alice live and and what industrious of workers named amul Associated so right now the generative prom is more Dynamic and we're not just take top three from our list okay guys so we have learned about what is NOLA gr why is it important how to set up our data in May for database how to chat with our data using lank chain and open source Lam and last but not least how to enhance our model I hope this video is useful for you guys and if you have any thoughts pleas for commment so please let me know in the comment section below bye-bye\", metadata={'source': 'KMXQ4SVLwmo'})]\n"

Outside of Apple, Cook engages in philanthropy; in March 2015 he said he planned to donate his fortune to charity.

He was baptized in a Baptist church and grew up in nearby Robertsdale. His father, Donald Cook, was a shipyard worker, and his mother, Geraldine Cook, worked at a pharmacy. Cook graduated salutatorian from Robertsdale High School in Alabama in 1978. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in industrial engineering from Auburn University in 1982 and a Master of Business Administration degree from Duke University in 1988.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Pre-Apple era ===\\nAfter graduating from Auburn University, Cook spent twelve years in IBM\\'s personal computer business, ultimately as director of North American fulfillment. During this time, Cook also earned his MBA from Duke University, becoming a Fuqua Scholar in 1988. Later, he was the chief operating officer of the computer reseller division of Intelligent Electronics. In 1997, he became the vice president for corporate materials at Compaq, but took up his position at Apple six months later.\\n\\n\\n=== Apple era ===\\n\\n\\n==== Early career ====\\nIn 1998, Steve Jobs asked Cook to join Apple. In a commencement speech at Auburn University, Cook said he decided to join Apple after meeting Jobs:\\n\\nAny purely rational consideration of cost and benefits lined up in Compaq\\'s favor, and the people who knew me best advised me to stay at Compaq... On that day in early 1998, I listened to my intuition, not the left side of my brain or for that matter even the people who knew me best... no more than five minutes into my initial interview with Steve, I wanted to throw caution and logic to the wind and join Apple. My intuition already knew that joining Apple was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work for the creative genius and to be on the executive team that could resurrect a great American company.\\nHis first position was senior vice president for worldwide operations. Cook closed factories and warehouses, and replaced them with contract manufacturers; this resulted in a reduction of the company\\'s inventory from months to days. Predicting its importance, his group had invested in long-term deals such as advance investment in flash memory since 2005. This guaranteed a stable supply of what became the iPod Nano, then iPhone and iPad. Competitors at Hewlett-Packard described their cancelled HP TouchPad tablet computer and later said that it was made from \"cast-off, reject iPad parts\". Cook\\'s actions were recognized for keeping costs under control, and combined with the rest of the company, generated huge profits.\\n\\nIn January 2007, Cook was promoted to lead operations and was chief executive in 2009, while Jobs, in failing health, was away on a leave of absence.

He worked in radio and television since 1986 after he graduated from College of Mount Saint Vincent in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, New York. He was best known for his long run as the executive producer of Imus in the Morning, a show that was nationally syndicated from 1993 until its end in 2018.\\n\\n\\n== Controversies ==\\n\\n\\n=== Tim Cook \"religious bigot\" controversy ===\\nOn April 1, 2015, during the Imus in the Morning show on Fox Business, McGuirk called Apple CEO Tim Cook a \"bigot hypocrite\" for \"running his mouth\" about the subject of the religious freedom Indiana law passed the month prior.\\n\\nMcGuirk: There is a lot of hypocrisy. First of all, Governor Cuomo tells all his state employees don\\'t go to Indiana but he\\'s going to Cuba where gay marriage is illegal and they maybe throw you in jail. You have this hypocrite, this bigot hypocrite, Tim Cook, who is running his mouth about the whole thing.McShane: The Apple CEO?McGuirk: Yeah. He sells products to Iran. He sells products to Saudi Arabia where they execute people if they\\'re gay.McDowell: A hypocrite maybe, but a bigot?McGuirk: A religious bigot, yeah. He won\\'t allow these religious people to exercise their freedom.McShane: That seems too strong to me.McGuirk: It does seem strong but in my opinion it happens to be accurate. If he doesn\\'t allow this Orthodox Jewish guy to refuse service...the point of the law is to allow him to exempt himself from a certain situation.McShane: This will end up back in the Supreme Court somewhere.McGuirk: And the governor of Connecticut. Meanwhile the state has the same law.McShane: But I think there is a difference in the law in terms...there are small differences in these laws. Some of these state laws are just to protect you against the government not against another person. So there are differences in those state laws.McGuirk: Gay rights and religious freedom are not mutually exclusive. They both can exist in the same universe and compromises have to be made. That\\'s just the way we work things out in this country. Tim Cook has to put his money where his mouth is. If he really feels that way, stop marketing Apple products in Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Nigeria where they not only dump on women and treat them as second class citizens but as I said they would execute gay people.\\n\\n\\n=== Jill Carroll ===\\nOn the Imus in the Morning show, McGuirk was not known to shy away from saying whatever was on his mind, and always in a heavily accented \"Brooklyn cabdriver\" deadpan that seemed both to amuse and horrify Imus in equal measure. Imus\\' sidekick, Charles McCord, often played the role of the instigator, doing his best to egg on McGuirk.\\nFor example, after the release of The Christian Science Monitor reporter Jill Carroll, who was kidnapped in Iraq, McGuirk stated: \"She strikes me as the kind of woman who would wear one of those suicide vests. You know, walk into the tent or try and sneak into the Green Zone.\\n\\n\\n=== Cardinals O\\'Connor and Egan ===\\nThe son of Irish immigrants and an altar boy in his youth, McGuirk did impersonations of John Cardinal O\\'Connor and Edward Cardinal Egan (both Archbishops of New York) in which he \"fashions an oversize FedEx envelope into a cone on his head ... Using a high-pitched Irish brogue ... the producer-as-cardinal said on the March 16 installment of the show that \\'the only thing Hillary Clinton has in common with the late great President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, God rest his soul, is that they both enjoyed extramarital affairs with women.\\'\"\\n\\n\\n=== U.S. President Barack Obama ===\\nRegarding Presidential aspirant Barack Obama, McGuirk stated: \"He\\'s a neophyte, no experience.

The Lisa\\'s graphical user interface was partially inspired by strategically licensed demonstrations of the Xerox Star. Lisa far surpassed the Star with intuitive direct manipulation, like the ability to drag and drop files, double-click to launch applications, and move or resize windows by clicking and dragging instead of going through a menu. However, hampered by its high price of $9,995 (equivalent to $33,000 in 2023) and lack of available software, the Lisa was commercially unsuccessful.\\nParallel to the Lisa\\'s development, a skunkworks team at Apple was working on the Macintosh project. Conceived in 1979 by Jef Raskin, Macintosh was envisioned as an affordable, easy-to-use computer for the masses. Raskin named the computer after his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh. The initial team consisted of Raskin, hardware engineer Burrell Smith, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. In 1981, Steve Jobs was removed from the Lisa team and joined Macintosh, and was able to gradually take control of the project due to Wozniak\\'s temporary absence after an airplane crash. Under Jobs, the Mac grew to resemble the Lisa, with a mouse and a more intuitive graphical interface, at a quarter of the Lisa\\'s price.\\nUpon its January 1984 launch, the first Macintosh was described as revolutionary by The New York Times. Sales initially met projections, but dropped due to the machine\\'s low performance, single floppy disk drive requiring frequent disk swapping, and initial lack of applications. Author Douglas Adams said: \"But what I (and I think everybody else who bought the machine in the early days) fell in love with was not the machine itself, which was ridiculously slow and underpowered, but a romantic idea of the machine. And that romantic idea had to sustain me through the realities of actually working on the 128K Mac.\" Most of the original Macintosh team left Apple, and some followed Jobs to found NeXT after he was forced out by CEO John Sculley. The first Macintosh nevertheless generated cult enthusiasm among buyers and some developers, who rushed to develop entirely new programs for the platform, including PageMaker, MORE, and Excel. Apple soon released the Macintosh 512K with improved performance and an external floppy drive.

Macs are sold with the macOS operating system.\\nJef Raskin conceived the Macintosh project in 1979, which was usurped and redefined by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 1981. The Macintosh has a 9-inch monochrome monitor built into the case, and was launched in January 1984, after Apple\\'s \"1984\" advertisement during Super Bowl XVIII.\\nIn 1987, the Macintosh II brought color graphics.

Through most of the 1990s, the Mac was not fully competitive with commodity IBM PC compatibles.\\nThe 1996 acquisition of NeXT returned Steve Jobs to Apple, whose focused product oversight pushed the Mac mainstream with the 1998 iMac G3, the OS X operating system (renamed to macOS in 2016), and the Mac transition to Intel processors from 2005 to 2006. High pixel density Retina displays debuted in the iPhone 4 in 2010 and the MacBook Pro in 2012.

The device had a 14-inch CRT screen and a TV tuner card. It was not a commercial success, with only 10,000 sold before its discontinuation in 1994. That year, the company developed the Apple Interactive Television Box, a collaboration with BT Group and Proximus Group that was never released to the public. Apple\\'s final major attempt before the Apple TV was the Apple Pippin in 1990s, a combination home game console and networked computer.\\n\\n\\n== Models ==\\n\\n\\n=== First generation ===\\n\\nAt a September 2006 Apple special event, Apple announced the first-generation Apple TV. It was originally announced as \"iTV\" to fit into their \"i\"-based product naming convention, but was renamed \"Apple TV\" before launch due to a trademark dispute with British broadcasting network ITV, which threatened legal action against Apple. Pre-orders began in January 2007 and it was released in March 2007. It is based on a Pentium M processor and ran a variant of Mac OS X Tiger, and included a 40 GB hard disk for storing content. It supported output up to 720p on HDTVs via HDMI, and supported some standard definition televisions via component video. At launch, Apple TV required a Mac or Windows-based PC running iTunes on the same network to sync or stream content to it.\\nA model with a 160 GB hard drive was released in May 2007. The 40 GB version was discontinued in September 2009. In January 2008, it became a stand-alone device through a software update, which removed the requirement of iTunes syncing from separate computer, and allowed for media from services such as iTunes Store, MobileMe, and Flickr to be rented or purchased directly on the Apple TV.\\nIn July 2008, Apple released the software 2.1 update which added external recognition of iPhones and iPod Touches as alternative remote control devices to the Apple Remote. In September 2015, Apple discontinued iTunes support for the first-generation Apple TV, with accessibility being obstructed from such devices due to obsolete security standards.\\nThe first generation Apple TV can be modified into a makeshift intel Mac Mini, with a USB boot disk image being available online, and an install to the inbuilt hard drive possible by flashing the image to the hard drive through the USB booted disk. The device is not easily used unless a USB hub is installed, due to it only having one USB port.\\nThe first generation Apple TV has a 1 GHz Intel Pentium M CPU, and 256 MB of RAM. Neither the CPU or RAM can be upgraded without soldering, as both are soldered onto the motherboard. The device has one HDMI interface, one USB port, one 10/100 base T Ethernet port, and a Component video interface. Due to its thermal management design utilizing the upper case as a passive heat sink, the device gets warm when in use.

Apple also announced that the application would include turn-by-turn navigation, 3D maps, and the virtual assistant Siri. The mapping service was released on September 19, 2012. Following the launch, Apple Maps was heavily criticized, which resulted in a public apology by Apple CEO Tim Cook in late September and the departure of two key employees of Apple (see also §Early inaccuracy).\\nGoogle Maps was the default mapping app in iOS from the first generation iPhone in 2007. In late 2009, tensions between Google and Apple started when the Android version of Google Maps featured turn-by-turn navigation, a feature which the iOS version lacked. At the time, Apple argued that Google collected too much user data. When Apple made iOS 6 available, Google Maps could only be accessed by iOS 6 users via the web. Although Google did not immediately launch an iOS version Maps, shortly after the announcement of Apple Maps, Google did add a Flyover feature to its virtual globe application Google Earth. Three months later, in December 2012, Google Maps was released in the App Store. This version of Google Maps, unlike the previous version, featured turn-by-turn navigation. Shortly after it was launched, it was the most popular free application in the App Store.\\nSpeculation around Apple creating a mapping service of its own arose in 2009 after computer magazine Computerworld reported that Apple had acquired Jaron Waldman\\'s company Placebase, an online mapping service, in July of that year. The CEO of Placebase became a part of Apple\\'s \"Geo Team\". In the following two years, Apple acquired two more mapping related companies who specialized in 3D maps: Poly9 in 2010 and C3 Technologies in 2011. C3 Technologies\\' imagery was later used for the Flyovers feature in Apple Maps. Earlier in 2011, Apple indicated its plan for a mapping service when it stated on its website that it was collecting location data to create \"an improved traffic service in the next couple of years\" for iPhone users. In September 2012, when Apple Maps was released, a \"source\" connected to both Google and Apple Maps claimed to technology website TechCrunch that Apple was recruiting Google employees that worked on Google Maps.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012–2015 ===\\nIn the first year after its release, Apple Maps received a number of improvements which solved various errors in the application.

Having spent his career first at NeXT and then Apple, he was the senior vice president (SVP) of iOS Software at Apple Inc. from 2007 until October 2012.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nForstall grew up in a middle-class family in Kitsap County, Washington, the second-born of three boys to a registered-nurse mother Jeanne and an engineer father Tom Forstall. His older brother Bruce is also a senior software design engineer, at Microsoft.\\nA gifted student for whom skills such as programming \"came easily where they were difficult for others\", Forstall qualified for advanced-placement science and math class in junior high school, and gained experience programming on Apple IIe computers.\\nHe was skipped forward a year, entering Olympic High School in Bremerton, Washington, early where classmates recall his immersion in competitive chess, history, and general knowledge, on occasion competing at the state level. He achieved a 4.0 GPA and earned the position of valedictorian, a position he shared with a classmate, Molly Brown, who would later become his wife. He had established the goal of being a \"designer of high-tech electronics equipment\", as he proclaimed in an interview with a local newspaper.\\nEnrolling at Stanford University, he graduated in 1991 with a degree in symbolic systems.

Forstall was then placed in charge of designing user interfaces for a reinvigorated Macintosh line. In 2000, Forstall became a leading designer of the Mac\\'s new Aqua user interface, known for its water-themed visual cues such as translucent icons and reflections, making him a rising star in the company. He was promoted to SVP in January 2003. During this period, he supervised the creation of the Safari web browser. Lisa Melton, a senior developer on the Safari team, credited Forstall for being willing to trust the instincts of his team and respecting their ability to develop the browser in secret.\\nIn 2005, when Jobs began planning the iPhone, he had a choice to either \"shrink the Mac, which would be an epic feat of engineering, or enlarge the iPod\". Jobs favored the former approach but pitted the Macintosh and the iPod team, led by Forstall and Tony Fadell respectively, against each other in an internal competition. Forstall won that fierce competition to create iOS.

However, backlash from developers prompted the company to reconsider, with Jobs announcing in October 2007 that Apple would have a software development kit available for developers by February 2008. The SDK was released on March 6, 2008.\\nThe iPhone App Store opened on July 10, 2008. On July 11, the iPhone 3G was released and came pre-loaded with support for App Store.

However, Apple applied for a U.S. trademark on the term \"App Store\" in 2008, which was tentatively approved in early 2011. In June 2011, U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton, who was presiding over Apple\\'s case against Amazon, said she would \"probably\" deny Apple\\'s motion to stop Amazon from using the \"App Store\" name.

Apple created the device during a secretive collaboration with Cingular Wireless (later renamed AT&T Mobility) at an estimated development cost of US$150 million over thirty months. According to Jobs in 1998, the \"i\" word in \"iMac\" (and thereafter \"iPod\", \"iPhone\" and \"iPad\") stands for internet, individual, instruct, inform, and inspire.\\nApple rejected the \"design by committee\" approach that had yielded the Motorola ROKR E1, a largely unsuccessful \"iTunes phone\" made in collaboration with Motorola. Among other deficiencies, the ROKR E1\\'s firmware limited storage to only 100 iTunes songs to avoid competing with Apple\\'s iPod nano. Cingular gave Apple the liberty to develop the iPhone\\'s hardware and software in-house, a rare practice at the time, and paid Apple a fraction of its monthly service revenue (until the iPhone 3G), in exchange for four years of exclusive U.S. sales, until 2011.\\nJobs unveiled the first-generation iPhone to the public on January 9, 2007, at the Macworld 2007 convention at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. The iPhone incorporated a 3.5-inch multi-touch display with few hardware buttons, and ran the iPhone OS operating system with a touch-friendly interface, then marketed as a version of Mac OS X. It launched on June 29, 2007, at a starting price of US$499 in the United States, and required a two-year contract with AT&T.\\n\\nOn July 11, 2008, at Apple\\'s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2008, Apple announced the iPhone 3G, and expanded its launch-day availability to twenty-two countries, and it was eventually released in 70 countries and territories. The iPhone 3G introduced faster 3G connectivity, and a lower starting price of US$199 (with a two-year AT&T contract).

       " Document(page_content='On August 31, 2014, a collection of nearly five hundred private pictures of various celebrities, mostly women, with many containing nudity, were posted on the imageboard 4chan, and swiftly disseminated by other users on websites and social networks such as Imgur and Reddit. The leak was dubbed \"The Fappening\" or \"Celebgate\" by the public. The images were initially believed to have been obtained via a breach of Apple\\'s cloud services suite iCloud, or a security issue in the iCloud API which allowed them to make unlimited attempts at guessing victims\\' passwords. Apple claimed in a press release that access was gained via spear phishing attacks.\\nThe incident was met with varied reactions from the media and fellow celebrities. Critics argued the leak was a major invasion of privacy for the photos\\' subjects, while some of the alleged subjects denied the images\\' authenticity. The leak also prompted increased concern from analysts surrounding the privacy and security of cloud computing services such as iCloud—with a particular emphasis on their use to store sensitive, private information.\\n\\n\\n== Origin of the term ==\\n\"The Fappening\" is a jocular portmanteau coined by combining the words \"fap\", an internet slang term for masturbation, and the title of the 2008 film The Happening. Though the term is a vulgarism originating either with the imageboards where the pictures were initially posted or Reddit, mainstream media outlets soon adopted the term themselves, such as the BBC.  The term has received criticism from journalists like Radhika Sanghani of The Daily Telegraph and Toyin Owoseje of the International Business Times, who said that the term not only trivialized the leak, but also, according to Sanghani, \"[made] light of a very severe situation.\" Both articles used the term extensively to describe the event, including in their headlines.\\n\"Celebgate\" is a reference to the Watergate scandal.\\n\\n\\n== Procurement and distribution ==\\nThe images were obtained via the online storage offered by Apple\\'s iCloud platform for automatically backing up photos from iOS devices, such as iPhones. Apple later reported that the victims\\' iCloud account information was obtained using \"a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions\", such as phishing and brute-force attack guessing. It was believed that the images were obtained using an exploit in the Find My iPhone service. Court documents from 2014 indicated that one user created a fake email account called \"appleprivacysecurity\" to ask celebrities for security information.  The photos were being passed around privately for at least a couple of weeks before their public release on August 31. Some anonymous imageboard users at the time claimed that unreleased photos and videos exist.\\nThe hacker responsible for the leak, who described themselves as being a \"collector\", distributed the leaked images on the image boards 4chan and Anon-IB in exchange for Bitcoin.  Ultimately, the images were widely circulated online via other channels, including Imgur and Tumblr.  Celebrity gossip blogger Perez Hilton also re-posted some of the photos on his blog, but soon took them down and issued an apology, saying he had \"acted in bad taste\".\\nA major center of activity was the link-sharing website Reddit, where a subreddit, /r/TheFappening, was created for sharing the photos; in a single day, it amassed over 100,000 followers.

They are the seventeenth and current generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The devices were announced on September 12, 2023, during the Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California alongside the higher-priced iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. Pre-orders began on September 15, 2023, and the devices were made available on September 22, 2023. Like the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the 15 and 15 Plus are the first iPhones to replace the proprietary Lightning connector with USB-C to comply with European Union mandates.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nIn September 2021, the European Commission began considering a proposal to mandate USB-C on all devices in the European Union, including iPhones. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple would drop its proprietary Lightning connector by 2023. At the time of those claims, Apple was considering switching to USB-C due to the likelihood that the EU proposal would pass. The proposal was passed into law in October 2022, becoming the Radio Equipment Directive. Apple confirmed it would comply with the regulations later that month.\\nTwo weeks prior to the formal introduction of the iPhone 15, it was announced that some of the devices which were made in India would for the first time be sold around the world on the launch day.\\n\\n\\n== Design ==\\n\\nThe iPhone 15 is the first major redesign since the iPhone 12, featuring rounder edges and slightly curved display and back glass. Both models are available in five colors: blue, pink, yellow, green and black. This makes it the first entry level iPhone since the iPhone XR to not ship with a Product Red variant at launch.\\n\\n\\n== Hardware ==\\n\\n\\n=== Display ===\\nThe iPhone 15 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2556×1179 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz.

       "[Document(page_content='Timothy Donald Cook (born November 1, 1960) is an American business executive who is the current chief executive officer of Apple Inc. Cook had previously been the company\\'s chief operating officer under its co-founder Steve Jobs. Cook joined Apple in March 1998 as a senior vice president for worldwide operations, and then as executive vice president for worldwide sales and operations. He was appointed chief executive on August 24, 2011 after Jobs, who was ill and died that October, resigned. During his tenure as the chief executive, he has advocated for the political reform of international and domestic surveillance, cybersecurity, American manufacturing, and environmental preservation. \\nSince 2011 when he took over Apple, to 2020, Cook doubled the company\\'s revenue and profit, and the company\\'s market value increased from $348 billion to $1.9 trillion. Cook is also on the boards of directors of Nike, Inc. and the National Football Foundation; he is a trustee of Duke University, his alma mater. Outside of Apple, Cook engages in philanthropy; in March 2015 he said he planned to donate his fortune to charity. In 2014, Cook became the first chief executive of a Fortune 500 company to publicly come out as gay.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nTimothy Donald Cook was born on November 1, 1960, in Mobile, Alabama. He was baptized in a Baptist church and grew up in nearby Robertsdale. His father, Donald Cook, was a shipyard worker, and his mother, Geraldine Cook, worked at a pharmacy. Cook graduated salutatorian from Robertsdale High School in Alabama in 1978. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in industrial engineering from Auburn University in 1982 and a Master of Business Administration degree from Duke University in 1988.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Pre-Apple era ===\\nAfter graduating from Auburn University, Cook spent twelve years in IBM\\'s personal computer business, ultimately as director of North American fulfillment. During this time, Cook also earned his MBA from Duke University, becoming a Fuqua Scholar in 1988. Later, he was the chief operating officer of the computer reseller division of Intelligent Electronics. In 1997, he became the vice president for corporate materials at Compaq, but took up his position at Apple six months later.\\n\\n\\n=== Apple era ===\\n\\n\\n==== Early career ====\\nIn 1998, Steve Jobs asked Cook to join Apple. In a commencement speech at Auburn University, Cook said he decided to join Apple after meeting Jobs:\\n\\nAny purely rational consideration of cost and benefits lined up in Compaq\\'s favor, and the people who knew me best advised me to stay at Compaq... On that day in early 1998, I listened to my intuition, not the left side of my brain or for that matter even the people who knew me best... no more than five minutes into my initial interview with Steve, I wanted to throw caution and logic to the wind and join Apple. My intuition already knew that joining Apple was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work for the creative genius and to be on the executive team that could resurrect a great American company.\\nHis first position was senior vice president for worldwide operations. Cook closed factories and warehouses, and replaced them with contract manufacturers; this resulted in a reduction of the company\\'s inventory from months to days. Predicting its importance, his group had invested in long-term deals such as advance investment in flash memory since 2005. This guaranteed a stable supply of what became the iPod Nano, then iPhone and iPad. Competitors at Hewlett-Packard described their cancelled HP TouchPad tablet computer and later said that it was made from \"cast-off, reject iPad parts\". Cook\\'s actions were recognized for keeping costs under control, and combined with the rest of the company, generated huge profits.\\n\\nIn January 2007, Cook was promoted to lead operations and was chief executive in 2009, while Jobs, in failing health, was away on a leave of absence. In January 2011, Apple\\'s board of', metadata={'title': 'Tim Cook', 'summary': \"Timothy Donald Cook (born November 1, 1960) is an American business executive who is the current chief executive officer of Apple Inc.

After IBM introduced the IBM PC in 1981, its sales quickly surpassed the Apple II. In response, Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983. The Lisa\\'s graphical user interface was partially inspired by strategically licensed demonstrations of the Xerox Star. Lisa far surpassed the Star with intuitive direct manipulation, like the ability to drag and drop files, double-click to launch applications, and move or resize windows by clicking and dragging instead of going through a menu. However, hampered by its high price of $9,995 (equivalent to $33,000 in 2023) and lack of available software, the Lisa was commercially unsuccessful.\\nParallel to the Lisa\\'s development, a skunkworks team at Apple was working on the Macintosh project. Conceived in 1979 by Jef Raskin, Macintosh was envisioned as an affordable, easy-to-use computer for the masses. Raskin named the computer after his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh. The initial team consisted of Raskin, hardware engineer Burrell Smith, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. In 1981, Steve Jobs was removed from the Lisa team and joined Macintosh, and was able to gradually take control of the project due to Wozniak\\'s temporary absence after an airplane crash. Under Jobs, the Mac grew to resemble the Lisa, with a mouse and a more intuitive graphical interface, at a quarter of the Lisa\\'s price.\\nUpon its January 1984 launch, the first Macintosh was described as revolutionary by The New York Times. Sales initially met projections, but dropped due to the machine\\'s low performance, single floppy disk drive requiring frequent disk swapping, and initial lack of applications. Author Douglas Adams said: \"But what I (and I think everybody else who bought the machine in the early days) fell in love with was not the machine itself, which was ridiculously slow and underpowered, but a romantic idea of the machine. And that romantic idea had to sustain me through the realities of actually working on the 128K Mac.\" Most of the original Macintosh team left Apple, and some followed Jobs to found NeXT after he was forced out by CEO John Sculley. The first Macintosh nevertheless generated cult enthusiasm among buyers and some developers, who rushed to develop entirely new programs for the platform, including PageMaker, MORE, and Excel.

Despite the failure, years later, then-hardware chief Dan Riccio and former Ford engineer and iPhone engineer Steve Zadesky returned to Musk to discuss ideas for a collaboration.

Apple also announced that the application would include turn-by-turn navigation, 3D maps, and the virtual assistant Siri. The mapping service was released on September 19, 2012. Following the launch, Apple Maps was heavily criticized, which resulted in a public apology by Apple CEO Tim Cook in late September and the departure of two key employees of Apple (see also §Early inaccuracy).\\nGoogle Maps was the default mapping app in iOS from the first generation iPhone in 2007. In late 2009, tensions between Google and Apple started when the Android version of Google Maps featured turn-by-turn navigation, a feature which the iOS version lacked. At the time, Apple argued that Google collected too much user data. When Apple made iOS 6 available, Google Maps could only be accessed by iOS 6 users via the web. Although Google did not immediately launch an iOS version Maps, shortly after the announcement of Apple Maps, Google did add a Flyover feature to its virtual globe application Google Earth. Three months later, in December 2012, Google Maps was released in the App Store. This version of Google Maps, unlike the previous version, featured turn-by-turn navigation. Shortly after it was launched, it was the most popular free application in the App Store.\\nSpeculation around Apple creating a mapping service of its own arose in 2009 after computer magazine Computerworld reported that Apple had acquired Jaron Waldman\\'s company Placebase, an online mapping service, in July of that year. The CEO of Placebase became a part of Apple\\'s \"Geo Team\". In the following two years, Apple acquired two more mapping related companies who specialized in 3D maps: Poly9 in 2010 and C3 Technologies in 2011. C3 Technologies\\' imagery was later used for the Flyovers feature in Apple Maps. Earlier in 2011, Apple indicated its plan for a mapping service when it stated on its website that it was collecting location data to create \"an improved traffic service in the next couple of years\" for iPhone users. In September 2012, when Apple Maps was released, a \"source\" connected to both Google and Apple Maps claimed to technology website TechCrunch that Apple was recruiting Google employees that worked on Google Maps.\\n\\n\\n=== 2012–2015 ===\\nIn the first year after its release, Apple Maps received a number of improvements which solved various errors in the application. Other changes included adding more satellite imagery and making the navigation available in more cities. In 2013, Apple also acquired a few companies to improve Apple Maps, namely HopStop, Embark, WifiSlam, and Locationary, as well as the team and the technology of the company BroadMap.

The device had a 14-inch CRT screen and a TV tuner card. It was not a commercial success, with only 10,000 sold before its discontinuation in 1994. That year, the company developed the Apple Interactive Television Box, a collaboration with BT Group and Proximus Group that was never released to the public. Apple\\'s final major attempt before the Apple TV was the Apple Pippin in 1990s, a combination home game console and networked computer.\\n\\n\\n== Models ==\\n\\n\\n=== First generation ===\\n\\nAt a September 2006 Apple special event, Apple announced the first-generation Apple TV. It was originally announced as \"iTV\" to fit into their \"i\"-based product naming convention, but was renamed \"Apple TV\" before launch due to a trademark dispute with British broadcasting network ITV, which threatened legal action against Apple. Pre-orders began in January 2007 and it was released in March 2007. It is based on a Pentium M processor and ran a variant of Mac OS X Tiger, and included a 40 GB hard disk for storing content. It supported output up to 720p on HDTVs via HDMI, and supported some standard definition televisions via component video. At launch, Apple TV required a Mac or Windows-based PC running iTunes on the same network to sync or stream content to it.\\nA model with a 160 GB hard drive was released in May 2007. The 40 GB version was discontinued in September 2009. In January 2008, it became a stand-alone device through a software update, which removed the requirement of iTunes syncing from separate computer, and allowed for media from services such as iTunes Store, MobileMe, and Flickr to be rented or purchased directly on the Apple TV.\\nIn July 2008, Apple released the software 2.1 update which added external recognition of iPhones and iPod Touches as alternative remote control devices to the Apple Remote. In September 2015, Apple discontinued iTunes support for the first-generation Apple TV, with accessibility being obstructed from such devices due to obsolete security standards.\\nThe first generation Apple TV can be modified into a makeshift intel Mac Mini, with a USB boot disk image being available online, and an install to the inbuilt hard drive possible by flashing the image to the hard drive through the USB booted disk. The device is not easily used unless a USB hub is installed, due to it only having one USB port.\\nThe first generation Apple TV has a 1 GHz Intel Pentium M CPU, and 256 MB of RAM. Neither the CPU or RAM can be upgraded without soldering, as both are soldered onto the motherboard. The device has one HDMI interface, one USB port, one 10/100 base T Ethernet port, and a Component video interface. Due to its thermal management design utilizing the upper case as a passive heat sink, the device gets warm when in use. A fan is used to cool the case, but it does not reach the CPU and is instead installed to cool the hard drive and installed power supply.\\n\\n\\n=== Second gene', metadata={'title': 'Apple TV', 'summary': 'Apple TV is a digital media player and microconsole developed and marketed by Apple Inc.

Since the fourth-generation model, Apple TV runs tvOS with multiple pre-installed apps.  In November 2019, Apple released Apple TV+ and Apple TV app a la carte.\\nApple TV lacks integrated controls and can only be controlled remotely, through a Siri Remote, iPhone or iPad, Apple Remote, or third-party infrared remotes complying with the fourth generation  Consumer Electronics Control standard.\\n\\n', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV'}),\n",

Jobs was also the founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.\\nJobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak\\'s Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics and PostScript.\\nIn 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company\\'s board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets, serving as its CEO. In 1986, he helped develop the visual effects industry by funding the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm that eventually spun off independently as Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995) and became a leading animation studio, producing over 27 films since.\\nIn 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company\\'s acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the \"Think different\" advertising campaign, and leading to the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone, App Store, and iPad. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor in 2011, and in 2022, was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family ===\\nSteven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah \"John\" Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي). Abdulfattah Jandali was born in a Muslim household to wealthy Syrian parents, the youngest of nine siblings. After obtaining his undergraduate degree at the American University of Beirut, Jandali pursued a PhD in political science at the University of Wisconsin. There, he met Joanne Schieble, an American Catholic of Swiss-German descent whose parents owned a mink farm and real estate in Green Bay. The two fell in love but faced opposition from Schieble\\'s father due to Jandali\\'s Muslim faith. When Schieble became pregnant, she arranged for a closed adoption, and travelled to San Francisco to give birth.\\nSchieble requested that her son be adopted by college graduates. A lawyer and his wife were selected, but they withdrew after discovering that the baby was a boy, so Jobs was instead adopted by Paul Reinhold and Clara (née Hagopian) Jobs. Paul Jobs, an American of German descent, was the son of a dairy farmer from Washington County, Wisconsin. After dropping out of high school, he worked as a mechanic, then joined the US Coast Guard. When his ship was decommissioned at San Francisco, he bet he could find a wife within 2 weeks.

       " Document(page_content='The iPhone is a line of smartphones produced by Apple Inc. that use Apple\\'s own iOS mobile operating system. The first-generation iPhone was announced by then–Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS updates. As of November 1, 2018, more than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold.\\nThe iPhone was the first mobile phone to use multi-touch technology. Since the iPhone\\'s launch, it has gained larger screen sizes, video-recording, waterproofing, and many accessibility features. Up to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, iPhones had a single button on the front panel, with the iPhone 5s and later integrating a Touch ID fingerprint sensor. Since the iPhone X, iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel-less front screen design with Face ID facial recognition, and app switching activated by gestures. Touch ID is still used for the budget iPhone SE series.\\nThe iPhone is one of the two largest smartphone platforms in the world alongside Android, and is a large part of the luxury market. The iPhone has generated large profits for Apple, making it one of the world\\'s most valuable publicly traded companies. The first-generation iPhone was described as a \"revolution\" for the mobile phone industry and subsequent models have also garnered praise. The iPhone has been credited with popularizing the smartphone and slate form factor, and with creating a large market for smartphone apps, or \"app economy\". As of January 2017, Apple\\'s App Store contained more than 2.2 million applications for the iPhone.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nDevelopment of an Apple smartphone began in 2004, when Apple started to gather a team of 1,000 employees led by hardware engineer Tony Fadell, software engineer Scott Forstall, and design officer Jony Ive, to work on the highly confidential \"Project Purple\".\\nThen-Apple CEO Steve Jobs steered the original focus away from a tablet (which was later revisited in the form of the iPad) towards a phone. Apple created the device during a secretive collaboration with Cingular Wireless (later renamed AT&T Mobility) at an estimated development cost of US$150 million over thirty months. According to Jobs in 1998, the \"i\" word in \"iMac\" (and thereafter \"iPod\", \"iPhone\" and \"iPad\") stands for internet, individual, instruct, inform, and inspire.\\nApple rejected the \"design by committee\" approach that had yielded the Motorola ROKR E1, a largely unsuccessful \"iTunes phone\" made in collaboration with Motorola. Among other deficiencies, the ROKR E1\\'s firmware limited storage to only 100 iTunes songs to avoid competing with Apple\\'s iPod nano. Cingular gave Apple the liberty to develop the iPhone\\'s hardware and software in-house, a rare practice at the time, and paid Apple a fraction of its monthly service revenue (until the iPhone 3G), in exchange for four years of exclusive U.S. sales, until 2011.\\nJobs unveiled the first-generation iPhone to the public on January 9, 2007, at the Macworld 2007 convention at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. The iPhone incorporated a 3.5-inch multi-touch display with few hardware buttons, and ran the iPhone OS operating system with a touch-friendly interface, then marketed as a version of Mac OS X. It launched on June 29, 2007, at a starting price of US$499 in the United States, and required a two-year contract with AT&T.\\n\\nOn July 11, 2008, at Apple\\'s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2008, Apple announced the iPhone 3G, and expanded its launch-day availability to twenty-two countries, and it was eventually released in 70 countries and territories. The iPhone 3G introduced faster 3G connectivity, and a lower starting price of US$199 (with a two-year AT&T contract). It proved commercially popular, overtaking Motorola RAZR V3 as the best selling cell phone in the US by the end of 2008. Its successor, the iPhone 3GS, was announced on June 8, 2009, at WWDC 2009, and introduced video recording functionality.\\n\\nThe iPhone 4 was announced on June 7, 2010, at WWDC 2010, ', metadata={'title': 'IPhone', 'summary': 'The iPhone is a line of smartphones produced by Apple Inc. that use Apple\\'s own iOS mobile operating system.
